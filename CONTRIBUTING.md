# How can you contribute? :)

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to our repository ❤️

You can contribute to the repository in several ways, below we list four ways we think (but there are other several ways)

### Create an issue

Found any problem or has an idea of an improvement but you don't know or do not have time to code it? Create an issue! Someone can take your issue and you will help a lot the repository!

### Code an issue

You don't have any idea of an improvement? Maybe someone has already thought of something! Check our issues to see if there isn't anything you can enjoy to code :)

### Just code anything

Do you have a great idea on your mind? Just code it!


## Some hints to guide your PR

- Check if makes sense to create a function inside an already existing module, you can check all module discriptions in the [README.md](./ourtoolkit/README.md) inside ourtoolkit.
- If there aren't any modules that suit your new function you can create a new one!
- Document your changes! If you added a new function or module explain your newest creation in the [README.md](./ourtoolkit/README.md), so everyone can use it
